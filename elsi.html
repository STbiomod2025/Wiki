<h1>What is ELSI ?</h1>
<p>
ELSI stands for Ethical, Legal, and Social Issues. It is a concept that collectively refers to various non-technical problems arising during the research, development, and societal implementation of new science and technology.

Although the term ELSI originated with the Human Genome Project, it is now used not only in medicine and biotechnology but also in AI and data science. The ethical aspect concerns the impact of using developed technologies on values and fairness. The legal aspect involves the challenge of how to establish legal frameworks to accommodate new technologies and values. The social aspect addresses how to gain societal acceptance and understanding.

Thus, to disseminate new science and technology throughout society, fostering the creation of new industries and even changes in lifestyles, it is necessary to address all these issues.

<h2>Ethical Issues</h2>
  <h3>Safety in Medical Applications</h3>
  <p>NeutraAvidin is prepared to suppress the non-specific binding inherent in natural avidin. As a result, it binds specifically to biotin with very low non-specificity.
  </p>
  <p>This means it is less likely to affect normal tissues in the body, even when used in drug delivery systems (DDS). However, repeated administration of avidin in pre-targeting approaches, such as for cancer therapy, has suggested a risk of enhanced anti-immune responses. Furthermore, avidin is an egg white-derived protein and thus a foreign protein, potentially triggering immune reactions in the body. Therefore, further research on its immunogenicity is necessary for clinical application. Nano-medicine poses challenges for obtaining appropriate informed consent because its complex and unpredictable mechanisms of action make it difficult for patients to fully understand the risks.

<h2>Legal Issues</h2>
  <h3>Handling of genetically modified avidin</h3>
  <p>Handling of genetically modified avidin

Neutra Avidin is not genetically modified, as it primarily removes sugar chains from avidin through chemical modification to enhance specificity. However, Neutra Avidin with a neutralized isoelectric point achieved by modifying the amino acid sequence, and further de-glycosylated, also exists (recombinant Neutra Avidin). When using Neutralite Avidin, it is essential to handle it carefully to prevent environmental impact, ensuring it does not leak from the laboratory in accordance with applicable laws.

<h2>Social Issues</h2>
  <h3>Social impacts</h3>
  <p>DNA curvature structures utilizing avidin-biotin binding can be employed for BAR domain recreation and drug delivery systems due to their robustness. These structures serve as model organs to elucidate biological phenomena and are expected to significantly contribute to the medical field as novel drug therapies.
