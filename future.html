<h1>1.Application to the Plane</h1>
    <p>In this project, we demonstrated that dsDNA can bend due to the avidin-biotin binding force.             </p>
    <p>By biotin-modifying multiple thymine bases within a DNA origami plane, it is possible to reproduce multiple instances of this curved dsDNA structure on the DNA origami plane. Combining the two variables of biotin-to-biotin distance and linker length enables precise design of curved DNA origami. Furthermore, in this design, a single biotin-modified DNA origami plane can adopt multiple curved structures by varying the avidin concentration. This is because changes in avidin concentration alter the proportion of biotin that binds to avidin and adopts a curved structure.Therefore,Adjusting avidin concentration allows control over changes in the 3D DNA structure. Furthermore, although degradation efficiency is low, degrading avidin with proteases would enable reversible structural control—curving the structure or restoring it to its original state.
    </p>
<h1>2.Practical Use</h1>
    <p>The DNA curved structure we propose exhibits tolerance to environmental changes such as temperature and ion concentration. This property makes it suitable for application in drug delivery systems navigating diverse environments within living organisms. It can serve as a tool providing stable structures when utilizing complex-shaped DNA origami as a DDS. Furthermore, designing the curvature of DNA origami to conform to the shape of biological membranes enhances uptake efficiency into target cells (facilitating endocytosis induction). Additionally, unused biotin-binding sites on avidin can be utilized as loading sites for drugs conjugated to biotin. As a nanoscale curved surface with potent drug-loading capacity, it holds promise for medical applications.
    </p>
    <p> Focusing on the motility regulated by avidin concentration and the reversibility induced by proteases in our proposed curved structure, its application as an ‘artificial BAR domain’ is anticipated. BAR domains are proteins that form crescent-shaped dimers. They are pressed against lipid membranes and function to physically assist in forming membrane curvature[1]. In other words, they serve as scaffolds for cell membrane formation. Our DNA curved structure possesses sufficiently high rigidity as a scaffold and has the potential to reproduce the deformation and repetitive motion of biological membranes, making it suitable for mimicking BAR domain function. Realizing an artificial system closer to the biological environment could yield new insights into the behavior of biological membranes.
